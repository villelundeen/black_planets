# Black Planets

## About
Black Planets is two-player game where each player is controlling their own UFO. Taking turns, the players use their UFOs to try to shoot the other player's UFO. The shot projectiles are affected by the gravity of planets generated into the game. After a player successfully hits the other player's UFO, the player being hit loses a life and the level is regenerated with a new random planet configuration. In addition to planets, wormholes may appear on a level, enabling teleportation between pairs of wormholes. The first player to deplete the lifes of the other player is the winner of the game.
