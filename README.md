# Black Planets

## About
Black Planets is two-player game where the both players have a UFO each. Taking turns, the players use their own UFOs try to shoot the other player's UFO. The shot projectiles are affected by the gravity of the planets generated into the game. After a player successfully hits the other player's UFO, the player being hit loses a life and the level is regenerated with a new random planet configuration. In addition to planets, wormholes may appear on a level, enabling teleportation between wormholes. The first player to deplete the lifesof the other player is the winner of the game.
